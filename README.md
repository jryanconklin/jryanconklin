### Hi, I'm J. Ryan Conklin. :joy_cat:

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- :goat: Iâ€™m currently working on Web Components
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Dungeons & Dragons

Iâ€™m a pattern library creator, librarian, curator, and full-stack developer. I enjoy creating build tools to make my colleagues lives a little easier. I love using technology to solve real problems, but I strive to put people first when making decisions. I care passionately about peopleâ€™s experience; whether thatâ€™s creating an accessible-by-default page or improving front-end development tools. Technology is all about people.

### What it's like working with me

#### As a Developer

- :hearts: **Authentic**. I value being fully authentic, honest, and being myself in everything I do. I care deeply about my work and the people I work with.
- :tada: **Refactoring**. It's never right the first time! Nothing is ever perfect but I'll keep trying to push my work toward some version of better.
- :corn: **Puns**. I want to make the team laugh (or groan laugh). Work should be fun!

#### As a Manager

- :guardsman: **Brand Manager**. I'll do the work to make you shine your brightest.
- :bear: **Counselor**. Do you need someone to listen? I'm always here for you.
- :boat: **Navigator**. Any organization has a lot of process and I'm here with the maps to make sure you succeed.

### What you can do to make me super happy

- :zap: **Honesty**. I value honest and direct communication. I like knowing where we stand.
- :duck: **Collaborate**. I love the process of improvement and bouncing ideas off others. I love a good rubber ducky session.
- :flower_playing_cards: **All In**. I commit to a project and value going "all in" with likeminded folks!
